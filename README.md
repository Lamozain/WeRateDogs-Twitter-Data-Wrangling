# WeRateDogs Twitter Data Wrangling

## Overview
The goal of this project was to Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations, and specifically to:
- Perform data wrangling (gathering, assessing and cleaning) on provided thee sources of data.
- Store, analyze, and visualize the wrangled data.
- Report on 1) data wrangling efforts and 2) data analyses and visualizations.

In addition, as per project specificacion, only original tweets/ratings that have images should be used in the analysis (no retweets nor replies).

This project was completed as part of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) certification.

## Data Origin
[We Rate Dogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) is a Twitter account with funny or interesting facts and pictures about dogs (mainly)...

## Results
The data wrangling process (data collection from different sources, data assessing and cleaning) resulted in two analytics-ready datasets used for a simplified analysis (full analysis is out of scope of this exercise).
